  bio: [
    'I studied Computer Science at the Technical University of Darmstadt and graduated in 2016 with my bachelor thesis on Motion Sickness in Virtual Reality. Since then I have been working as a Software and Web Developer with a focus on Angular and React.',
    'In my work I have seen that every company is different, but many face the same challenge: keeping their digital presence accessible, modern and future proof. A lot of businesses already know that accessibility is required by law, but in practice what matters most is that a website works for all users in a simple and enjoyable way.',
    'My specialization is Web Accessibility (WCAG 2.1, BFSG, European Accessibility Act). I help companies update their websites and applications so they are compliant and at the same time easy to use for everyone. What my clients value is that I combine technical expertise in Angular, React and TypeScript with a human centered approach. Because accessibility is not just about code, it is about people.',
    'If you are wondering whether your website already meets accessibility standards, or if you feel it is time to make your online presence more inclusive and legally compliant, I would be glad to support you. Often just a few clear steps can make a big difference, helping your website reach more people and stand out from the competition.',
    "Let's connect and see how we can make your website barrier free, modern and ready for the future.",
